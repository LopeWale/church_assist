1. Requirements:

SpeechRecognition library for Python or OpenAI's Whisper API.
A Bible API to fetch the scripture.
tkinter for GUI.
A reliable internet connection for speech recognition and accessing the Bible API.
2. File Structure (OOP Approach):

<p>project_directory/
│
├── main.py
│
├── gui/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main_window.py
│   └── display_window.py
│
├── speech_recognition/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── recognizer.py
│
└── bible_api/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── api_connector.py
</p>

3. Descriptions:

main.py: Entry point of the application.

gui/: Contains GUI related classes.

main_window.py: Defines the main control window GUI.
display_window.py: Defines the output screen that displays the scripture to the congregation.
speech_recognition/: Contains classes for speech recognition.

recognizer.py: Class to handle speech recognition, possibly using OpenAI's Whisper API or another SR library.
bible_api/: Contains classes to interact with the Bible API.

api_connector.py: Defines methods to fetch scripture based on recognized verses or references.
4. Steps:

Speech Recognition: The recognizer.py will listen to the pastor's speech in real-time and detect mentions of Bible verses or references.

Fetch Scripture: Once a Bible verse or reference is recognized, the api_connector.py will fetch the corresponding scripture using the Bible API.

Display Scripture: The fetched scripture will be displayed on the output screen defined in display_window.py.

GUI Control: The main_window.py will provide the operator with control options such as starting/stopping the speech recognition, manually selecting a verse, etc.

5. Example Class Descriptions:

SpeechRecognizer in recognizer.py: Handles speech recognition.

BibleAPIConnector in api_connector.py: Connects to the Bible API and fetches scripture.

MainWindow in main_window.py: Defines the GUI for the control window.

DisplayWindow in display_window.py: Defines the GUI for the output screen.

6. Handling Dual Monitor Display:
To handle dual monitors with tkinter, you can create two separate tkinter windows, one for the control screen and the other for the congregation screen. You can position these windows on the desired monitors by setting their geometry.
